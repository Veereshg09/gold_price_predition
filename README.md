# Gold Price Prediction Web App

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts gold prices using three machine learning models:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Tree

It also fetches the **real-time gold price** using an external API and compares the predictions to actual market values.
